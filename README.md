Hello! This project is designed to enhance 3D print support quality. To get started, you generally need to follow these steps. (Download manual.pdf for further details)
1.	Have some gluepen refills("点点胶替芯" in Chinese）and one bottle of liquid glue.
Get two M2.5*5 screws and two magnets with a diameter of 4mm and a thickness of 1.5mm.
2.	Download the 3D printing models provided in the folder and print them. Assemble the printed parts and install them in a proper location on your 3D printer. You may need some modification in order to suit your own printer. 
3.	Configure Settings: Run the software and fill in the required information in the dialog box. It will generate a config file. Then copy the path of MKP3.0.exe and go to your Orca Slicer settings, paste it and change several settings. If you’re using printers shipped with klipper firmware, then creating several macro is prefered.
4.	Click Slicing button and enjoy. You can also place your Gcode file in the same folder as this software.
