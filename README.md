1.Download and Print:
Download the 3D printing models provided in the folder and print them.
2.Assemble and Install: 
Assemble the printed parts and install them in a proper location on your 3D printer.
3.Configure Settings:
Run the software and fill in the required information in the dialogbox.
4.Prepare Your Gcode:
Place your 3D printing Gcode file in the same folder as this software.
5.Run the Software: 
Start the software to process your Gcode.
Once the software has finished processing, you will have the output Gcode file ready for printing.
