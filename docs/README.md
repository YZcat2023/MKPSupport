## About The Project

When printing parts using FDM 3D printers, supports often pose a significant challenge. They can be difficult to remove,
leaving the surface of the part uneven. Therefore, reducing the layer adhesion between the support layers and the part
could be a viable solution. That's why we're here—to introduce MKP Support, which delivers better results: the support
surface is smooth, flat, and non-sticky, with no color difference from the main body of the part. Thanks to the
incorporated function of ironing the support surface, the results may even surpass those achieved with water-soluble
supports. With just four magnets, two screws, K30 , and other necessary items, you can upgrade your
printer. It can be run as a post-processing program in BambuSlicer. Simply press the button, just like in the previous
workflow!

Here's why:

* Using MKP Support can reduce waste of time and materials.
* Using MKP Support can enhance the surface finish of the contact area.
* Using MKP Support can increase the success rate of printing.

## Samples

Here are some printed samples. More photos may come, stay tuned!

## Getting Started
Before starting, we suggest joining our group(QQ)，668350689.

For more details, please refer to [MKP Manual.pdf](MKP-English.pdf).

1. Have some gluepen refills("点点胶替芯" in Chinese）and K30.
   Get two M2.5*5 screws and four magnets with a diameter of 4mm and a thickness of 1.5mm.
2. todo(video, manuals,etc)
3. calibrate

## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve AMS support
