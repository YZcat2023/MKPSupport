## ✨ What is MKP Support?

Still troubled by hard-to-remove 3D printing supports and the marks they leave behind? MKP Support makes removing supports as easy as peeling off a sticky note!

**In simple terms**: We've invented a method of applying an adhesive layer on the support interface, which leaves the contact surface smooth and flat, almost invisible, and incredibly easy to remove.

## 🖊️ Why is it better than traditional methods?

**Compared to standard supports**: No more prying with knives or pulling with pliers. Say goodbye to scratched fingers, while achieving an exceptionally smooth finish.

**Compared to water-soluble supports**: No need to buy specialized water-soluble filaments, no worries about moisture absorption. The results are nearly identical, but the cost is completely different.

**Extremely simple assembly**: The parts only require magnets, screws, springs (for P1/X1), pen refills, etc.

## 🎯 Expected Results

✅ **Saves Time**: Support removal goes from minutes to seconds.

✅ **Saves Material**: MKP doesn't require material changes or flushing.

✅ **Perfect Surface**: The support contact surface is flat and smooth.

✅ **Increases Success Rate**: Reduces the risk of damage during support removal.
